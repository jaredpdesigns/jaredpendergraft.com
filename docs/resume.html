We have a running joke in the office that Jared is a unicorn. Its mildly true though. Jared is a quick thinker and thoughtful communicator that consistently presents clever solutions. His skill set is impressive and seemingly limitless as he is adept at the intuitive, aesthetic, and functional dimensions of what makes a great digital experience. It’s a delight working with someone that blends a love for technology and clean, effective design. I learn something new with every project we work together and I have fun along the way. Jared has a great sense of humor and is a respectable family man. I’ve considered myself very lucky to work with such a bright, professional individual and would highly recommend the opportunity to collaborate with him. <strong>Bristol Dunlap</strong></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Jared is one of the few rare individuals I’ve encountered who embodies the creative abilities of an artist and the solution-oriented capabilities of software programmer. This combination makes him uniquely suited to tasks that require both a design mindset as well as a developer one — something that usually requires two people. The fact that he enjoys both the art and the programming is an even bigger plus. Jared approaches his projects with an innate ability to apply design thinking while being mindful of usability concerns, which results in a very elegant product. He is very diligent and thorough in his work. The more time he is given, the better the results will be. In addition, Jared is a genuinely nice person and a great pleasure to work with. He would be a major asset in any organization. I recommend him highly in any position that can utilize his talents and abilities to their full potential. <strong>Peter Liu</strong></p> </blockquote> </section> </article> </main> </body> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js" async></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/site.js" async></script> </html>
