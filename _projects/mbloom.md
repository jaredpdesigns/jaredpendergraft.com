mbloom is Hawaii’s first early-stage technology fund focused on investing in teams working to improve the world with revolutionary technologies. Our task was to establish a professional website and mature the brand.

Our goal was to position the company as knowledgable and welcoming to early-stage companies seeking advice about entering into investment circles. We wanted to demystify funding and offer advice to those starting out.

We expanded the color palette to include two primary colors and introduced [Gotham Rounded](http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham-rounded/overview/) and [Sentinel](http://www.typography.com/fonts/sentinel/overview/) to establish, a professional, inviting tone.

Friendly illustrations peppered throughout the site strengthen the core message of inclusion and help round out the new brand positioning very well.
