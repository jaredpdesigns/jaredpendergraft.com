1. **Initial discovery and research** — figure out what we’re building and what problems we’re trying to solve.
2. **Style and tone** — explore visual ideas and establish the voice of the project.
3. **Present ideas and determine technical constraints** — finalize approval of visual direction and confirm what was designed can be built.
4. **Finalize information architecture and build** — confirm our design supports established content models and begin development. 
5. **Test, optimize and iterate** — perform A/B testing when applicable to confirm assumptions, optimize content for best performance, and determine what can be improved in the next cycle.
