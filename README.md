# Jared Pendergraft

![Hello, it’s nice to meet you](https://images.ctfassets.net/cuehicrlqnvu/48OC0pyrFD6iWSokRiz3Zs/f9fb4d4df16062af7a4eb885b1abc08e/profile-big.jpg?f=face&fit=fill&w=240&h=240)

I’m a multi-disciplinary designer focusing on the *intersection of design and development*. I care deeply about how something works as much as its outward appearance and am always looking to *improve, optimize and scale my ideas*.

I approach design challenges holistically, building solutions from beginning to end with *extensibility and modularity* in mind. I enjoy building out designs to fully-functional front-end code—bridging the gap between design and development seamlessly.
