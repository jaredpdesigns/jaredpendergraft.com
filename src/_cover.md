I’d love to get more information about the UI/UX Designer position with You Need A Budget. My experience as a Creative Director and Front-End Developer brings a unique combination of creativity and logic to my work.

I’ve worked within small teams to develop and iterate upon several products in various stages of development. My contributions have included design conception, UI/UX improvements to existing designs as well as front-end HTML/CSS/JavaScript development.

I put the user first and care deeply about crafting engaging experiences that surprise and delight. The code I write is clean, semantic and performant. I’m a team player who works well with creatives and engineers and I always strive to improve myself in the projects I contribute to.

Please feel free to reach out with any additional questions or clarification. My portfolio is available for viewing at http://jaredpendergraft.com, also check out my Github (https://github.com/jaredpdesigns) and Dribbble profile (https://dribbble.com/jaredpdesigns) for more in-progress projects. I look forward to hearing from you.
