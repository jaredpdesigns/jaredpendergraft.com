## The parties agree as follows

1. **Services.** {{ page.consultant }} will provide services (the “Services”) to {{ page.client-name }} as specified in *Schedule A.* All design and development efforts will be done remotely unless otherwise stated.
2. **Expenses.** {{ page.client-name }} will reimburse {{ page.consultant }} for expenses incurred in providing the Services, but only if those expenses have been approved in advance and in writing.
3. **Payment.** Unless otherwise specified in *Schedule A*, {{ page.consultant }} will invoice {{ page.client-name }} upon completion of Services and for expenses. {{ page.client-name }} will pay the invoices within 7 days of receipt (the “Due Date”) if {{ page.consultant }} performed the Services as required. {{ page.client-name }} agrees to pay {{ page.consultant }} ${{ page.hourly }} per hour for additional services not outlined in *Schedule A* — additional tasks will not be undertaken without the explicit written approval of {{ page.client-name }}.
4. **Interest.** {{ page.client-name }} will pay {{ page.consultant }} simple interest on all overdue payments at a rate of 5% per month. Interest is calculated from the date payment was due until the date payment, including accumulated interest, is made in full.
5. **Term.** This Agreement will be in effect until the Services are completed, unless ended earlier as specified in *section 6*.
6. **Termination by Consultant.** {{ page.consultant }} may end this Agreement if:
	1. {{ page.client-name }} fails to pay any amounts owing to {{ page.consultant }} within 7 days after the Due Date, or
	2. {{ page.client-name }} breaches any other fundamental obligation in this Agreement and does not remedy the breach within 5 days after receiving written notice of the breach from {{ page.consultant }}.
	3. {{ page.client-name }} does not respond to the correspondence from {{ page.consultant }} within 5 days.
7. **Effect of Termination.** When this Agreement ends for any reason:
	1. {{ page.client-name }} will immediately pay {{ page.consultant }} all outstanding expenses and Fees for Services performed as required, up to the date of termination;
	2. sections *9, 10, 11, 12* will survive the end of this Agreement.
8. **Confidentiality.**
	1. “Confidential Information” means all information (whether in oral, written or electronic form) relating to the business, technology, personnel, marketing, customers, finances, products or services of {{ page.client-name }}, and includes confidential information received by {{ page.client-name }} from third parties, but excludes any information that:
		1. was lawfully in the possession of {{ page.consultant }} before receiving it from {{ page.client-name }};
		2. is provided in good faith to {{ page.consultant }} by a third party without breaching any rights of {{ page.client-name }} or any other party;
		3. is or becomes generally available to, or accessible by, the public through no fault of {{ page.consultant }}; or
		4. is independently developed by {{ page.consultant }} without use of the disclosed Confidential Information.

	3. {{ page.consultant }} will keep {{ page.client-name }}’s Confidential Information confidential, and will also cause its directors, officers, employees and agents to keep {{ page.client-name }}’s Confidential Information confidential. {{ page.consultant }} will take all necessary steps (including those steps that {{ page.consultant }} takes to protect its own information that it regards as confidential) to maintain the confidentiality of {{ page.client-name }}’s Confidential Information.
	4. {{ page.consultant }} will not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, nor the fact that it has obtained the Confidential Information, without the explicit written approval of {{ page.client-name }}.
	5. If {{ page.consultant }} receives notice indicating that it may or will be legally required to disclose any of {{ page.client-name }}’s Confidential Information, it will notify {{ page.client-name }} promptly in writing so that {{ page.client-name }} may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, or waive compliance with this Agreement. If a protective order or other remedy is not obtained for whatever reason, or if {{ page.client-name }} waives compliance with this Agreement, ￼{{ page.consultant }} will disclose no more than that portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed.
9. **Intellectual Property.** {{ page.consultant }} agrees that {{ page.client-name }} will have exclusive ownership in all work product (the “Work Product”) that {{ page.consultant }} produces under this Agreement, after all invoices have been paid in-full, including {{ page.consultant }}’s copyright interest in the Work Product, except for the materials (the “Consultant’s Materials”) specified in *Schedule A.* All rights to work product will remain with {{ page.consultant }} until all invoices are paid in full. {{ page.consultant }} retains the right to display images of the Work Product and its branding on their portfolio.

10. **Assignment and Moral Rights.** {{ page.consultant }} hereby assigns to {{ page.client-name }} all rights, title and interest {{ page.consultant }} may now or in the future have in and to the Work Product. {{ page.consultant }} waives {{ page.consultant }}’s moral rights to any and all copyrights subsisting in the Work Product. If required by {{ page.client-name }}, {{ page.consultant }} also agrees to sign, and to cause {{ page.consultant }} to sign, any applications or other documents {{ page.client-name }} may reasonably request: [a] to obtain or maintain patent, copyright, industrial design, trade-mark or other similar protection for the Work Product, [b] to transfer ownership of the Work Product to {{ page.client-name }}, and [c] to assist {{ page.client-name }} in any proceeding necessary to protect and preserve the Work Product. {{ page.client-name }} will pay for all expenses associated with preparing and filing such documents.
