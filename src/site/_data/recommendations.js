    comment: `<p>As a designer at Kontur Labs, and also as a contract designer for hire, Jared demonstrated a consistent ability to design creative and purpose driven experiences. Initially, he was hired as a visual designer but we soon discovered he is actually a hybrid of UX, visual design and front end dev.</p><p>When working within the constraints of an agency contract, there isn’t often budget for usability testing and extensive customer discovery. Jared was able compensate by leveraging best practices and low budget user testing to make sure his designs were accomplishing the desired goals.</p><p>His ability to “design with code” allowed us to pick up considerable speed in the “design to HTML” creation phases of our projects. We were able to remove hours spent wire framing and working with a visual designer and go right form IA, content curation/gathering and sketches into HTML and CSS.</p><p>This resulted in a boost in profitability of our agency contracts. Furthermore, he would test his HTML/CSS for browser compatibility before handing off to engineering. This allowed us to spend less time on quality assurance.</p><p>Jared is also a change agent. He is constantly expanding his skill sets and encouraged us to use new tools and explore new ways of working together that were more collaborative—not just as a team but with our clients. He is a pleasure to work with and I highly recommend him as an addition to any agency or product team.</p>`,

    comment: `<p>Jared is an exceptional worker and person. I felt very lucky to have the chance to work with him while at Kontur Labs. He is honest, knowledgable and delivers quality results. Everything he does is done with integrity as he cares about the work he puts out into the world. He has a great sense of humor and is a great team player. Our office called him the unicorn as he is the unique combination of designer and coder.</p><p>I would highly recommend Jared to anyone looking for an art director, designer or developer.</p>`,

    comment: `<p>I hired Jared to design the Playbill for our big summer show, <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>, in addition to a variety of advertisements, both print and digital, and other marketing material. Jared did a superb job and delivered all the materials well ahead of his deadlines. He made it all look easy. Prior to this, Jared and I were co-workers at Kontur Labs for two years, where he demonstrated the same level of professionalism, talent and expertise. He is one of the few designers I’ve met who also understands programming and the world of code.</p><p>I continue to collaborate with Jared as projects come up. I recommend him highly for any endeavor that requires a talented and well trained designer.</p>`,
