        I’m a multi-disciplinary designer focusing on the intersection of design
        and development. I enjoy building out designs to fully-functional
        front-end code—bridging the gap between design and development
        seamlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m looking for a creative position that offers challenges,
        collaboration and mentorship, with an ability to work on projects that
        impact the world positively.

        <li>
          I’m a thorough thinker who approaches design challenges holistically—I
          build solutions from beginning to end with extensibility and
          modularity in mind.
        </li>
        <li>
          I care deeply about how something works as much as its outward
          appearance—I love to tinker and am always looking to improve, optimize
          and scale my ideas.
        </li>
        <li>
          I’m a lifelong learner who’s always looking to reposition my opinions
          to reflect new information and become a well-informed, kinder human.
        </li>
        <li>
          When I work with others it’s about listening and sharing in the
          creation of new ideas—the things we make together are always better
          when we collaborate.

        <li>
          <strong>Responsive Web Design:</strong>&ensp;screens are everywhere,
          web things should scale and squish and transform to meet the
          challenges of modern day devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Experience:</strong>&ensp;screens must be intuitive and a
          joy to use, the interfaces and experiences should reflect this above
          all else.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Branding & Identity:</strong>&ensp;brands are built around how
          they look, how they speak, and how they make you feel—hopefully all
          three.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Project Management:</strong>&ensp;every project consists of
          many moving parts, each piece must be overseen and nurtured to
          contribute to a successful whole.

        <p>
          Jared is an exceptional worker and person. I felt very lucky to have
          the chance to work with him while at Kontur Labs. He is honest,
          knowledgable and delivers quality results. Everything he does is done
          with integrity as he cares about the work he puts out into the world.
          He has a great sense of humor and is a great team player. Our office
          called him the unicorn as he is the unique combination of designer and
          coder.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would highly recommend Jared to anyone looking for an art director,
          designer or developer.
        </p>
      </Recommendation>
      <Recommendation class="legible" person="Peter Liu">
        <p>
          I hired Jared to design the Playbill for our big summer show,
          <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>, in addition to a variety of
          advertisements, both print and digital, and other marketing material.
          Jared did a superb job and delivered all the materials well ahead of
          his deadlines. He made it all look easy. Prior to this, Jared and I
          were co-workers at Kontur Labs for two years, where he demonstrated
          the same level of professionalism, talent and expertise. He is one of
          the few designers I’ve met who also understands programming and the
          world of code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I continue to collaborate with Jared as projects come up. I recommend
          him highly for any endeavor that requires a talented and well trained
          designer.
        </p>
      </Recommendation>
      <Recommendation class="legible" person="Alexis Wogan">
        <p>
          As a designer at Kontur Labs, and also as a contract designer for
          hire, Jared demonstrated a consistent ability to design creative and
          purpose driven experiences. Initially, he was hired as a visual
          designer but we soon discovered he is actually a hybrid of UX, visual
          design and front end dev.
        </p>
        <p>
          When working within the constraints of an agency contract, there isn’t
          often budget for usability testing and extensive customer discovery.
          Jared was able compensate by leveraging best practices and low budget
          user testing to make sure his designs were accomplishing the desired
          goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          His ability to “design with code” allowed us to pick up considerable
          speed in the “design to HTML” creation phases of our projects. We were
          able to remove hours spent wire framing and working with a visual
          designer and go right form IA, content curation/gathering and sketches
          into HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          This resulted in a boost in profitability of our agency contracts.
          Furthermore, he would test his HTML/CSS for browser compatibility
          before handing off to engineering. This allowed us to spend less time
          on quality assurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jared is also a change agent. He is constantly expanding his skill
          sets and encouraged us to use new tools and explore new ways of
          working together that were more collaborative—not just as a team but
          with our clients. He is a pleasure to work with and I highly recommend
          him as an addition to any agency or product team.
