	5. If Jared Pendergraft receives notice indicating that it may or will be legally required to disclose any of {{ client.client.name }}’s Confidential Information, it will notify {{ client.client.name }} promptly in writing so that {{ client.client.name }} may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, or waive compliance with this client.
