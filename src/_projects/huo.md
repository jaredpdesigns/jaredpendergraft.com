Huŏ Ceramics was a small-scale project with a lot of personality. We were given the opportunity to create an identity  and website for renowned Chinese artist Zhou Xiaoping — an honored and awarded Chinese traditional crafts master whose singular pieces are collected and revered world-wide.

He was primarily selling his pieces through small collector’s circles but wanted to reach a broader audience. Our solution was a modern identity and simple website focusing on the details of each piece.

### Branding

***

The brand is inspired by both Zhou’s refined firing technique and his role as the sole flame preserving the celadon technique.  

Because the pieces are all of varying sizes, it was important to focus on a compact brand mark that provided equal contrast on either light or dark backgrounds — even at small sizes.

In addition to the above brand mark a series of illustrations were developed to accompany printed materials shipped with the products.

### Website

***

The website focuses on showcasing the pieces with bold images set in high contrast. Celadon ceramics emphasize small cracks and imperfect textures — we wanted to bring attention to these subtle details by focusing on specific angles while also remaining a bit mysterious.

While viewing individual products, we drop some of the contrast to focus on details and allow customers to get a sense of the craftsmanship that goes into every piece.
