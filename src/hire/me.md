# About Me

**I’m a multi-disciplinary designer focusing on the _intersection of design and development_—specifically _Design Systems_ and how teams work together to build amazing products.**

I specialize in building modular, scalable UI frameworks and empowering teams with systems thinking, clean implementation, and accessibility best practices. I’m looking for a creative position that offers challenges, collaboration, and an opportunity to work on products that positively impact the world.

## Core Principles

- I’m a thorough thinker who approaches design challenges holistically—I build solutions from beginning to end with extensibility and modularity in mind.
- I care deeply about how something works as much as its outward appearance—I love to tinker and am always looking to improve, optimize and scale my ideas.
- I’m a lifelong learner who’s always looking to reposition my opinions to reflect new information and become a well-informed, kinder human.
- When I work with others it’s about listening and sharing in the creation of new ideas—the things we make together are always better when we collaborate.
