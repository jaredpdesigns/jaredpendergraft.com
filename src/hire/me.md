# Résumé

I’m a multi-disciplinary designer focusing on the _intersection of design and development_—specifically _Design Systems_ and how teams works together to build amazing products.

I’m looking for a creative position that offers challenges, collaboration, and an ability to work on projects that impact the world positively.

## Capabilities

- I’m a thorough thinker who approaches design challenges holistically—I build solutions from beginning to end with extensibility and modularity in mind.
- I care deeply about how something works as much as its outward appearance—I love to tinker and am always looking to improve, optimize and scale my ideas.
- I’m a lifelong learner who’s always looking to reposition my opinions to reflect new information and become a well-informed, kinder human.
- When I work with others it’s about listening and sharing in the creation of new ideas—the things we make together are always better when we collaborate.

## Philosophies

- **Responsive Web Design:** screens are everywhere, web things should scale and squish and transform to meet the challenges of modern day devices.
- **User Experience:** screens must be intuitive and a joy to use, the interfaces and experiences should reflect this above all else.
- **Branding & Identity:** brands are built around how they look, how they speak, and how they make you feel—hopefully all three.
- **Project Management:** every project consists of many moving parts, each piece must be overseen and nurtured to contribute to a successful whole.

## Technologies

- **Fundamentals:** CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Prototyping, User Research
- **Content Management:** Contentful, Jekyll, Shopify, Wordpress
- **Frameworks:** Blazor, React, Vue, Swift UI
