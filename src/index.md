# Hello, It’s Nice to Meet You

**I’m a multi-disciplinary designer and developer working at the _intersection of design and development_—with a deep focus on _Design Systems_ and how teams build products together at scale.**

I care just as much about how something works as how it looks, and I’m always exploring ways to **improve, optimize, and scale design through thoughtful engineering**. I approach challenges holistically—crafting systems and experiences that are **modular, extensible, and built to evolve**.

> I’m currently a **Senior Software Development Engineer** at **Zillow**, working on the _Design Foundations_ team that supports **Constellation**, the company’s centralized design system. View my [projects](/#side-projects) or explore my [creative process](/hire/#my-creative-process).
