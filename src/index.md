# Hello, It’s Nice to Meet You

**I’m a multi-disciplinary designer focusing on the _intersection of design and development_—specifically _Design Systems_ and how teams works together to build amazing products.**

I care deeply about how something works as much as its outward appearance and am always looking to **improve, optimize and scale my ideas**. I approach design challenges holistically, building solutions from beginning to end with **extensibility and modularity** in mind.
