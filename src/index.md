# Hello, It’s Nice to Meet You

**I’m a multi-disciplinary designer focusing on the _intersection of design and development_—specifically _Design Systems_ and how teams works together to build amazing products.**

I care deeply about how something works as much as its outward appearance and am always looking to **improve, optimize and scale my ideas**. I approach design challenges holistically, building solutions from beginning to end with **extensibility and modularity** in mind.

> I’m currently serving as **Senior Software Development Engineer** at **Zillow** on the _Design Foundations_ team. View [projects](/#side-projects) I’ve worked on or learn more about my [creative process](/hire/#my-creative-process).
