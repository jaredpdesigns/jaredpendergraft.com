# Hello. My name is Jared, it’s nice to meet you.

I’m a multi-disciplinary designer focusing on the intersection of design and development. I care deeply about how something works as much as its outward appearance and am always looking to improve, optimize and scale my ideas.

I approach design challenges holistically, building solutions from beginning to end with extensibility and modularity in mind. I enjoy building out designs to fully-functional front-end code—bridging the gap between design and development seamlessly.

With over 15 years of experience working within a variety of industries including healthcare, technology and education, I have created successful design solutions for both analog and digital environments.

If you’d like to work together please reach out via <a href="mailto:hello@jaredpendergraft.com?subject=Hey Jared, love the site, how’s it going?">email</a> *or* follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jaredpdesigns) *or* [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/jaredpdesigns).
