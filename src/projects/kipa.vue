  <p>In Maui, a lot of tourists visit the island to take in surfing, hiking and other outdoor activities, often booking tours through resorts or other ‘pay a little, go with a lot of people’ experiences. We saw the potential to change that—hire a local expert and see what the locals see—leaving the island with a one-of-a-kind experience worth sharing with friends.</p>
  <p>Kipa offers a platform for local tour guides to post their services and get hired for one-on-one tours or tours with you and a few of your friends. The goal with the interface was to get as much information to potential customers about what to expect on a tour, make booking as easy as possible and offer a clear communication channel to the guides, who often are meeting customers for the first time when they give the tour. After a tour is complete, guides can capture a rating from the customer and finalize payment processing.</p>
  <p>Kipa is still under development but the long-term goals for the platform are to make the service available all over the world, expanding past outdoor activities to more personal experiences like booking a local in Portland to take you to the city’s best coffee and book shops.</p>
